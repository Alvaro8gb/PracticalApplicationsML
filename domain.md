# Edema

Edema refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces (spaces between cells) of the body. 
This excess fluid leads to swelling or puffiness, usually in the affected tissues. Edema can occur in various parts 
of the body and may result from several different causes. Some common areas where edema can occur include the legs, ankles, feet, and hands.
- Liver disease: Certain liver conditions can cause a decrease in the production of proteins needed to maintain fluid balance, contributing to edema.

# Ascitis
Liquid is abdomen but related with hepatic disease.

# Spiders
In the context of liver disease, is likely referring to a medical sign known as spider angiomas or spider nevi.

Spider angiomas are small, dilated blood vessels near the surface of the skin that radiate from a central point and resemble the legs of a spider. 
They can be a manifestation of liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. The presence of spider angiomas may be an indication of increased pressure 
in the blood vessels around the liver.

So, in this context:
- N (No): Indicates that there are no spider angiomas present, suggesting a lower likelihood of certain liver issues.
- Y (Yes): Indicates that spider angiomas are present, which might be associated with liver disease, and further investigation or medical attention may be needed.

# Hepatomegaly
In the context of a medical evaluation related to liver disease, 
"Hepatomegaly: presence of hepatomegaly N (No) or Y (Yes)" is asking whether the patient has an enlarged liver.

- N (No): Indicates that there is no hepatomegaly, meaning the liver is not enlarged beyond the normal size.
- Y (Yes): Indicates that hepatomegaly is present, suggesting that the liver is enlarged. Hepatomegaly can be 
caused by various liver conditions, including fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatitis, or other underlying health issues.
The presence of hepatomegaly is an important clinical sign that healthcare professionals may consider in their assessment 
of liver health and function. If hepatomegaly is detected, further investigation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.
